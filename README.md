# Blockchain-Based Global Digital Identity & Border Control System

## Project Title
Blockchain-Based Global Digital Identity & Border Control System

## Project Description
This project aims to revolutionize global travel and border security by utilizing blockchain technology. It provides a decentralized and tamper-proof identity verification system, ensuring secure and seamless identity management for travelers and authorities.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to establish a global, secure, and verifiable digital identity system that eliminates fraud, enhances security, and simplifies the travel process. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure immutability, transparency, and accessibility of identity records.

## Future Scope
- **Integration with Governments & Airlines**: Implement the system at international airports and border security checkpoints.
- **Multi-Blockchain Support**: Expand support beyond Ethereum to other blockchain networks.
- **AI-Based Identity Verification**: Use AI and biometrics to enhance identity authentication.
- **Smart Contracts for Visa Processing**: Automate visa issuance and verification through blockchain smart contracts.
- **Cross-Border Collaboration**: Allow multiple countries to securely share identity data for enhanced security.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Identity Storage**: User identity is stored on the blockchain, making it immutable and secure.
- **Tamper-Proof Verification**: Once registered, identity data cannot be altered, preventing identity fraud.
- **Smart Contract-Based Authentication**: Identity verification is automated using Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Seamless API Integration**: A backend API built with Node.js and Web3.js interacts with the blockchain.
- **User Privacy & Security**: Users control their identity data, and only authorized entities can access it.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Can be integrated with various applications such as airport security, visa processing, and digital passports.

## API Endpoints
- **POST /registerIdentity** - Registers a new identity on the blockchain.
- **GET /getIdentity/:address** - Retrieves identity details from the blockchain.
- **POST /verifyIdentity** - Verifies an identity against stored blockchain data.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Smart Contracts, Web3.js)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: No centralized database (all identity data is stored on the blockchain)
- **Frontend**: (To be developed) React.js for UI
- **Deployment**: Infura for Ethereum node access, MetaMask for wallet interaction

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/blockchain-identity-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd blockchain-identity-system
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up the `.env` file with the following details:
   ```ini
   INFURA_URL="https://goerli.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID"
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS="0xYourSmartContractAddress"
   PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key"
   ```
5. Start the backend server:
   ```sh
   node src/server.js
   ```
6. Test API endpoints using Postman or a browser.

## Future Enhancements
- **Biometric Authentication**: Use fingerprints and facial recognition.
- **Interoperability with Other Blockchains**: Support for Polkadot, Solana, etc.
- **Mobile App Integration**: Develop a mobile-based identity wallet.
